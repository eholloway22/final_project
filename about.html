    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>My name is Evan Holloway and I have loved videogames all my life. When I was given the opportunity to make one, as apart of the Hidden Genius Project, I was very excited. Within the first week of building the game, I had many thoughts about how my game could "compete" with some of the big games now, even though it never came close to it. For the past several weeks, I have created this Super Mario Bros type game which is simple and sweet. I now have a better understanding of how much time and effort game developers put into their craft to create new ideas, which I now have more respect for</p>
